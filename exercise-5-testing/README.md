In this exercise were going to explore how to test NgRx concepts like actions, selectors...

- How to test actions
- How to test selectors
- How to test reducers
- How to test effects
- How to test components which use store


## How to start

- try searching for `// TODO` in the `projects` folder or use TODO functionality of your editor 

## How to use exercises

- every exercise folder should be installed using `npm ci`
- every exercise can be started using `npm start` to run the app
- every exercise can start tests in watch mode using `npm run watch` (jest) or you can also start the test directly from your IDE. Some test might be failing in the beginning before the implementation was provided
- every exercise has it's own `README.md` file with additional description of the given exercise
- every exercise project contains ordered `// TODO` comments inside of the source code (eg `// TODO 1: description`) which should be followed to complete the given exercise
